1. Minesweeper? Could be tough.
  So I want to re-make the basic game of minesweeper that is found on computers. I'll need to make a grid that interacts with the user. I want to detect how many bombs are next to the square that the user selects, I want to display a different color and end the game if you have selected a bomb. I don't think I'm going to do the bit where it clears multiple squares.
